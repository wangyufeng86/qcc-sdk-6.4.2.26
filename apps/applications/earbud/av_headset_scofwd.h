            to the peer device, used for forwarding timestamped SCO audio.

/*! Although there is an accurate time source between each end of

    of the link.

    This is made up of 3 parts.

    - The WBS decoder, which includes Packet Loss Concealment,
      buffers some data before output. This offsets the Time To 
      Play (TTP) that is output compared to the TTP that is input. 
      The eventual TTP is earlier by 6063us. Although this is 
      compensated for in the decoder, SCO forwarding needs to be
      aware to help calculate transit times.
    - Small offset due to the alignment of samples to the local clock 
      This is not compensated for as direction and value vary based on
      the alignment of clocks.
    - Unexplained, but repeatable offset (not compensated, ~13us)

    The receive end of the link will remove \ref SFWD_WBS_UNCOMPENSATED_OFFSET_US
